# React Custom Hooks Examples

This is a companion project to my post "Creating Custom Hooks with React."

The project has 3 example components that are all basically the same "To-Do" list:

1. `ToDoListUseState.tsx` is a component that only uses the `useState` hook
2. `ToDoListCustomHooks.tsx` is a component that uses a custom hook called `useList`
3. `AdvancedToDoList.tsx` is a component that also uses the `useList` hook along with a hook called `useLocalStorage`

The post walks you through starting with the built in `useState` hook, and then transitioning to writing your own hooks. In addition to my post, I recommend you check out the [React Rules on Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) and the page on [creating your own hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html).
